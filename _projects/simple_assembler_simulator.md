This project is a simple assembler simulator for educational purposes, designed to help users understand the basics of assembly language and CPU instruction execution.

I contributed to this project during the Open Week 2025. Open Week is an event organized each year for one week by the ULC INGI department, where students can work on various open source projects. During the week, there are also other activities on the side and some company talks. I worked on this project with two other students. The project was based on an existing simulator that can be found [here](https://github.com/ntyunyayev/assembler-simulator).

Our initial objectives where to add a screen mapped in memory and any other quality of life improvements.

At the end of the week, we successfully implemented the following features:
- Screen mapped in memory
- New editor with syntax highlighting, auto-completion...
- Changed build system from Grunt (2009) to Vite (2025)
- Improved user interface (bye bootstrap)
- Changed framework from AngularJS (2013) to SolidJS (2025)
- New code examples
- Debugging tools
- Code stored in local storage
