This project is a guided presentation designed to help users learn LaTeX. It covers many basic and more advanced topics. Thoses slides are used by the Louvain-li-Nux association in our bi-annual LaTeX workshops. It was created based on previous versions and contributions from the Louvain-li-Nux members.

The presentation is built using Marp, a Markdown presentation tool that allows for easy creation of slides. You can view the source code on [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/louvainlinux/activities/atelier-latex).

The slides are hosted on a dedicated website.
